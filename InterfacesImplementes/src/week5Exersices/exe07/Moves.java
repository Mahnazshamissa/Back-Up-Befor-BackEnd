/*
Create an alternative version of the whole game code,
replacing the Move interface by the Move abstract class.
It has the getDefeats abstract method that returns
a list of String with the names of the moves that it defeats.
It has the getName abstract method. It has the defeats method,
which is not abstract, that receives a Move and
it returns a boolean that says if the name of that move
is contained in the list of names of getDefeats.
